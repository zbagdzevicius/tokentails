## Command Dispatch

`uv` is required. If `uv` is missing or cannot run, tell the user that
`uv` must be installed and stop. Do not write `_bmad` another way.

Run only the flow the user requested. `bmad update` is inspection only,
`bmad doctor` repairs an existing runtime, and `bmad setup` performs setup.

## `bmad update`

Run this command without creating an answer or temporary file:

```text
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --update
```

The JSON report contains one state per module and lists every installed copy by
skill id and version. Report `current`, `newer-available`, `ahead`,
`differing-unordered`, `could-not-check`, `version-spread`, or
`source-disagreement` exactly as emitted. Name every copy in a version spread,
include the source-specific reason for a failed check, and state the bmad copy
and version used. Never claim the installation is current unless the report's
top-level `current` is true.

This command re-scans installed skills and reads only each source
`module-manifest.toml`. It does not install, move, repair, or remove skills; does
not write the project or a lockfile; and does not run `npx skills update`. If an
update is available, tell the user that updating installed skill folders is the
responsibility of `npx skills update`.

## `bmad doctor`

Doctor requires `{project-root}/_bmad`. Either doctor command below reports
status `setup-required` when it is absent; relay that instruction to run
`bmad setup` and stop. Do not create a staging directory or any project output
yourself.

First list newly declared questions. This command is read-only:

```text
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --doctor --list-config-questions
```

The command prints a JSON array. Ask every returned question exactly once and
in array order, showing its `default`. Existing answers are absent from the
array and must not be re-asked or overwritten. An accepted default must be used
exactly as emitted.

When the array is non-empty, write only the returned module answers to a new
temporary TOML file using the same quoting, escaping, collision avoidance, and
`[modules."..."]` shape described under **Installed module questions** below.
Record its actual path as `{module-answers-path}`.

Run one of these commands:

```text
# No newly declared questions
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --doctor

# With newly declared answers
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --doctor --module-answers "{module-answers-path}"
```

On success, delete only the temporary answer file created for this doctor run.
Report the top-level `status` — `current` (nothing needed repair), `repaired`,
or `reconciled-with-warnings` (some module is still spread or blocked) — plus
the shared-script result, added answers, every module's selected or blocked
state, exact module-script repair result, remaining version spreads or
staleness, and the bmad copy/version used. When `legacy_leftovers` is
non-empty, mention that files from a classic BMad installer are present and
were left untouched. A successful local repair does not
mean project-scoped skill copies were updated; never call the whole installation
current while `version_spreads` or `remaining_staleness` is non-empty. Tell the
user that reconciling the installed copies of a blocked or spread module is the
responsibility of `npx skills update`.

Doctor preserves existing config answers, `custom/`, user layers, and
non-script module files. It makes shared and selected module script trees exact,
which can remove obsolete files below those script directories. If it reports
or raises malformed config, invalid manifests or answers, an unreadable script,
or an ambiguous module source, name the affected source. Do not attempt a
second repair path.

## `bmad setup`

Setup asks no questions of its own; the only questions come from installed
module manifests, below. A second run keeps existing team answers, including
non-string values, and asks only newly declared module questions. Files a
classic BMad installer left under `_bmad` are never modified or removed.
It also repairs `_bmad/scripts` when that path
is a symlink or a copy that is not byte-identical to the packaged `bmad`
skill's `scripts/`. Every symlink is replaced with a plain copy; a
byte-identical copy is left as-is; successful setup never attempts to create
a symlink. Never touch `custom/` or existing `*.user.toml`.

### Installed module questions

Discover unanswered installed module questions with the script in this
skill. This command is read-only:

```
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --list-config-questions
```

The command prints a JSON array. Ask every returned question exactly once and
in array order, showing its `default`. Do not ask a question when it is absent
from the array. If the user accepts a default, use the emitted default exactly:
the script has already expanded `{directory_name}` to the project directory
name while retaining `{project-root}` and unknown placeholders literally.

If the array is non-empty, write the selected answers with the Write tool (not
the shell) to `{project-root}/.bmad-help-setup-modules.toml`. If that path
already exists, choose another temporary path so no existing file is
overwritten. Record the path actually chosen as `{module-answers-path}`; this
is the default path above only when no collision required another name. Put
answers only below their returned module. Quote each returned key as one TOML
key so dotted keys remain unambiguous:

```toml
[modules."example"]
"simple_key" = "selected answer"
"nested.key" = "selected answer"
```

All values must be TOML basic strings. Escape backslashes, double quotes,
newlines, carriage returns, tabs, and other control characters correctly. Do
not place these answers in `config.user.toml` or another `*.user.toml`.

Run the skill-root script, with the module answer file when one was written:

```text
# No module answers
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}"

# With module answers
uv run --no-cache "{skill-root}/scripts/setup.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}" --module-answers "{module-answers-path}"
```

If discovery or setup reports malformed team TOML, conflicting or invalid
manifests, invalid answers, or an unreadable declared script, report the named
source and stop. Do not attempt another materialization path. After setup
succeeds, delete only the actual temporary answer paths created during this
setup, including `{module-answers-path}` when module answers were written.
